# LocalAdmin - ADSI
This small helper module contains a set of functions for Adding, removing, and reporting on local Windows 'Administrator' group membership via ADSI - useful for when reporting against or manipulating legacy operating systems like Server 2008 + 2012, but also currently works all the way through Server 2022
